What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px?

The layout changes to a much simpler list of the same content though stacked on top of each other for more responsiveness whilst using a mobil device, or smaller screen.

How do you think that works?

This can be done in the CSS style code by setting the width properties to suit.
