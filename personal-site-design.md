What is you site's primary purpose?

The primary purpose is to house all my phase-0 blog postings and project on.

Who is your target audience?

My target audience would primarily be my EDA peers and staff, though could also cater to those who may stumble upon my page (including friends and ffamily who are interested) 

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

I want them to be able to easily navigate through my blogs, and have a very responvies experience. I would also like to include my own personality, lifestyle and MƒÅori cultural elements on the page so it rightly represents myself.

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

I will have the first index page, a welcome page that will have a drop navigation bar to the blogs and projects. Each type of blog will then have it's own landing page in order to group and categorise these for a cleaner user experience.
